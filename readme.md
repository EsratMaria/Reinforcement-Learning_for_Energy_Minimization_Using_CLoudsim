# Q learning / Reinforcement Learning for energy consumption minimization using CLOUDSIM simulator

### Q Learning in Java

The Q learning scheduler for incoming requests can be found in this [directory](https://github.com/EsratMaria/Reinforcement-Learning_for_Energy_Minimization_Using_CLoudsim/tree/master/examples/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/QLearningScheduler).

The PlanetLab traffic generator provided by **CloudSim** has been used to conduct this experiment.
